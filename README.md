# Linear-Mixed-Models-R-Tutorials
Learn how to run linear mixed models with R!

Here I post different tutorials on how to fit linear models with R.
There will be mixed models, 1 way, 2 way, 3 way, with or without repeated measures, parametric and non parametric.
Stay tuned!
Feel free to contac me for any information you need.
I will be writing a blog with more detailed explanations about each step.
